Investigating Pertussis Resurgence

#Pertussis (more commonly known as whooping cough) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. People of all ages can be infected leading to violent coughing fits followed by a high-pitched intake of breath that sounds like “whoop”. Infants and toddlers have the highest risk for severe complications and death. Recent estimates from the WHO suggest that ~16 million cases and 200,000 infant deaths are due to pertussis annually 1.




1. Investigating pertussis cases by year 

```{r}
library(datapasta)
```


```{r}
cdc <- data.frame(
                                 Year = c(1922L,1923L,1924L,1925L,

       )
  
```



>Q1. With the help of the R “addin” package datapasta assign the CDC pertussis case number data to a data frame called cdc and use ggplot to make a plot of cases numbers over time.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cdc) +
  aes(x = cdc$Year, y= cdc$No..Reported.Pertussis.Cases) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y= "Number of cases", title= "Pertussis Cases by Year (1922-2019)" )

```


>Q2. Using the ggplot geom_vline() function add lines to your previous plot for the 1946 introduction of the wP vaccine and the 1996 switch to aP vaccine (see example in the hint below). What do you notice?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cdc) +
  aes(x = cdc$Year, y= cdc$No..Reported.Pertussis.Cases) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y= "Number of cases", title= "Pertussis Cases by Year (1922-2019)" ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept= 1946) +
  geom_vline(xintercept= 1996)


```
> Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

After the introduction of the aP vaccine, significant increase in number of cases appeared.


3. Exploring CMI-PB data

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
head(subject, 3)

```


>Q4. How may aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```

>Q5. How many Male and Female subjects/patients are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)

```

>Q6. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of Asian females, White males etc…)?

```{r}
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex)

```



```{r}
library(lubridate)
today()

#HOw many days have passed since new year 2000
today() - ymd("2000-01-01")

#What is this in years?
time_length( today() - ymd("2000-01-01"), "years")
```

>Q7. Using this approach determine (i) the average age of wP individuals, (ii) the average age of aP individuals; and (iii) are they significantly different?

```{r}
subject$age <- today() - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
library(dplyr)

ap <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "aP")

round( summary( time_length( ap$age, "years" ) ) )

# wP
wp <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "wP")
round( summary( time_length( wp$age, "years" ) ) )

```

>Q8. Determine the age of all individuals at time of boost?


```{r}
int <- ymd(subject$date_of_boost) - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
age_at_boost <- time_length(int, "year")
head(age_at_boost)

```

>Q9. Q9. With the help of a faceted boxplot (see below), do you think these two groups are significantly different?

```{r}
ggplot(subject) +
  aes(time_length(age, "year"),
      fill=as.factor(subject$infancy_vac)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(subject$infancy_vac), nrow=2)
```
```{r}
x <- t.test(time_length(wp$age, "years" ),
              time_length( ap$age, "years"))

x$p.value

```
There is significant difference.







#Joining multiple tables

```{r}
# Complete the API URLs...
specimen <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/specimen", simplifyVector = TRUE) 
titer <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/ab_titer", simplifyVector = TRUE)



```



>Q9. Complete the code to join specimen and subject tables to make a new merged data frame containing all specimen records along with their associated subject details:

```{r}
meta <- full_join(specimen, subject)
dim(meta)
head(meta)

```




>Q10. Now using the same procedure join meta with titer data so we can further analyze this data in terms of time of visit aP/wP, male/female etc.


```{r}
abdata <- inner_join(titer, meta)
dim(abdata)
```

>Q11. How many specimens (i.e. entries in abdata) do we have for each isotype?

```{r}
table(abdata$isotype)

```

>Q12. What do you notice about the number of visit 8 specimens compared to other visits?


```{r}
table(abdata$visit)

```

4. Examine IgG1 Ab titer levels

```{r}
ig1 <- abdata %>% filter(isotype == "IgG1", visit!=8)
head(ig1)
```

>Q13. Complete the following code to make a summary boxplot of Ab titer levels for all antigens:

```{r}
ggplot(ig1) +
  aes(ab_titer, antigen) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2)

```

>Q14. What antigens show differences in the level of IgG1 antibody titers recognizing them over time? Why these and not others?

FIM2/3

>Q15. Filter to pull out only two specific antigens for analysis and create a boxplot for each. You can chose any you like. Below I picked a “control” antigen (“Measles”, that is not in our vaccines) and a clear antigen of interest (“FIM2/3”, extra-cellular fimbriae proteins from B. pertussis that participate in substrate attachment).

```{r}
filter(ig1, antigen=="Measles") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(ab_titer, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit)) +
  theme_bw()

```


```{r}
filter(ig1, antigen=="FIM2/3") %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(ab_titer, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit)) +
  theme_bw()

```

>Q16. What do you notice about these two antigens time course and the FIM2/3 data in particular?

The FIM2/3 levels rise over time trend is very similary for wP and aP subjects

>Q17. Do you see any clear difference in aP vs. wP responses?

No there is no clear difference, some parts, wP has higher values, some aP has higher values.



5. Obtaining CMI-PB RNA Seq data

```{r}
url <- "https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/v2/rnaseq?versioned_ensembl_gene_id=eq.ENSG00000211896.7"

rna <- read_json(url, simplifyVector = TRUE) 

```


```{r}
meta <- inner_join(specimen, subject)
ssrna <- inner_join(rna, meta)
```

>Q18. Make a plot of the time course of gene expression for IGHG1 gene (i.e. a plot of visit vs. tpm).

```{r}
ggplot(ssrna) +
  aes(visit, tpm, group=subject_id) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(alpha=0.2)
```

>Q19.: What do you notice about the expression of this gene (i.e. when is it at it’s maximum level)?

When it is at maximum level, the visit number is 4.

>Q20. Does this pattern in time match the trend of antibody titer data? If not, why not?

Yes, it matches in a way where it takes time for it to reach peak.

```{r}
ggplot(ssrna) +
  aes(tpm, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit))
```

```{r}
ssrna %>%  
  filter(visit==4) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    aes(tpm, col=infancy_vac) + geom_density() + 
    geom_rug() 
```
